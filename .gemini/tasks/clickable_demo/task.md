# Task: Implement Clickable Image Pattern for Demo

## Status
- [ ] Generate premium thumbnail for demo video
- [ ] Replace broken `<video>` tag with `[![Image](Link)]` markdown syntax
- [ ] Commit and push

## Details
The user is unsatisfied with the HTML5 player look/reliability ("Its looking bad"). The most robust and premium-looking alternative is a high-quality static thumbnail that links to the video file. This works in 100% of browsers and markdown viewers.
